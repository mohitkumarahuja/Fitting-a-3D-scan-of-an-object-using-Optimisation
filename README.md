# Fitting-a-3D-scan-of-an-object-using-Optimisation
The main objective of this project was to obtain a new cloud of points by merging the 2 clouds • 1st difficulty: One is full for the second 10% of the points are missing • 2nd difficulty: for each cloud 10% of the points are missing • 1st step: on a classical geometrical volume • 2nd step: on real scans
